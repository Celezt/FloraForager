  "Name": "Porock",
  "Description": "Fibrous substance protected by a thick crust of minerals similar to rock found at [insert]. The rocky appearance can make it hard to distinguish, but the high concentrated carbon and fibre have made this root fruit a staple food source for many cultures across the galaxy. The crust is 0.5-1.0 mm thick, making it near impossible to crack without a tool or by dropping it from a high place. Because of its shell, few of the local species found around the world has the capability to extract the nutritious content inside of it; This has made Porock an exceptional crop in less developed locations that might have pest issues. The inner content inside of Porock has a bright yellowish tone that needs to boil at 200 C for 40 min to be digestible to humans.\r\n\r\nIf placed underground, the root can survive for decades waiting for the rain to come. The moist soil penetrates the crust leaving cracks that begin to sprout.\r"
