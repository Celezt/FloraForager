Flora Forager is a farming and exploration game. You can plant, harvest, fish, and gather to upgrade your equipment and unlock more of the world. The original idea was to have building elements, but in the end, it was scarped before the final version. 
 
You can speak and befriend the inhabitants and do quests. The more missions you succeed with, the friendlier they get. You save by going to the farmhouse, also used for sleeping. If your stamina bar goes to zero, you will faint and spawn at the farmhouse the next day.

**DISCLAIMER!** This game is just a demo and NOT a full-featured game. Because of the missing building mechanic, the game has pacing issues and the main story was never implemented. Only two NPCs exist, and they can give the player missions and have new dialogue if they get friendlier, but nothing more.

The story follows a new Flora Forager; interstellar gatherers of everything associated with plant life, including fungi. While taking the route back home, an abrupt notification from IFFC’s (Interstellar Flora Forage Consortium) rescue department notifies that one Flora Forager has gone missing on Viror: a deserted planet lost in time from unknown causes. It is up to the Flora Forager to rescue the missing person.

The young Flora Forager lands on this alien planet and sets up their base for days to come. They soon discover that the planet is in fact not deserted and that the inhabitants of the area have some problems and are unable to help the Flora Forager in their goal. With no other choice but to assist the inhabitants to finally uncover the truth of what happened to the missing person and Viror’s fate.
