Flora Forager is a farming and exploration game taking place on an alien planet. You play as Fiona, a young interstellar gatherer of everything associated with plant life, including fungi. You are on a rescue mission to find a colleague last seen on a once thought-to-be deserted planet. But as it turns out, there are still inhabitants living here.
 
This missing person turns out to be searching for the truth about their grandpa, that lived here decades ago. To find them, you need to befriend and help the inhabitants who have personal issues and are reluctant to help you otherwise.
